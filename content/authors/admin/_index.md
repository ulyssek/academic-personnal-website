Parisian, born and raised! Curiosity drove my whole life, and led me to the wonderful labs of Daniel Margulies and Sean Froudist-Walsh - my two PhD supervisors and mentors - where I study the emergence of conscious access from the cortex topological architecture. My passion for mathematics and computer science gave me a computational angle. 
<br/>I spend most of my time simulating global dynamics within whole cortex models and chilling on the river banks or rooftops of beautiful Paris.
<br/>
<br/>I'm deeply into scientific discussions, especially with people I don't agree with. This is, I guess, one of the reason that led me to the <a href="mesec.co">MESEC adventure</a>, a series of international Workshops and WinterSchools that I organize with friends from all around the globe, under the sun of the Mediterrean see.
