Parisian, born and raised! Curiosity drove my whole life, and led me to the wonderful labs of Daniel Margulies and Sean Froudist-Walsh - my two PhD supervisors and mentors - where I study the emergence of conscious access from the cortex topological architecture. My passion for mathematics and computer science gave me a computational angle. 
I spend most of my time simulating global dynamics within whole cortex models and chilling on the river banks or rooftops of the beautiful Paris.
